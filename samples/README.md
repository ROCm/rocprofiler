## ROCProfiler API Concepts
- Session
- Filter
- Buffer


## API Philosophy

The APIs provide a common interface to the users for different
features such as profiling, tracing.

In order to make use of any functionality of rocprofv2, one needs to create
a "Session" object. This session could be a profiling session/tracing/pc-sampling session etc.

In order to set user inputs, one needs to provide a "Filter" to a session object.
This filter could be for counters/traces/pc-samples etc.

Now that the input is taken care of, one also needs to provide a "Buffer" which
will store the output results generated during a session. This buffer will contain
different records corresponding to the filter type chosen. A flush function can also
be specified for the buffer, which will be used to flush the buffer records. 
A filter and buffer are associated together.

Once a Session, Buffer, Filter have all been created, the session can be started.
One can control when the session can be started, stopped and destroyed.

## Descriptions of Code Samples
### kernel_profiling_sample.cpp
This code sample demonstrates how to use the APIs to collect performance counters and metrics for every kernel dispatch.

### tracer_sample.cpp
This code sample demonstrates how to use the APIs to collect different API and activity traces:
- HIP API
- HIP OPS
- HSA API
- HSA OPS
- ROCTX

### device_profiling_sample.cpp
This code sample demonstrates how to use the APIs to collect counters and metrics from the GPU via user defined sampling, instead of per-kernel dipatch measurements.


## How to compile
In order to get the samples to compile, make sure to copy rocprofiler binaries into /opt/rocm/lib
Running 'make install' inside the rocprofiler/build folder will copy the binaries to /opt/rocm/lib

Alternately, change the 'ROCPROFILER_LIBS_PATH' variable in the Makefile to point to the rocprofiler/build folder. 
After modifications to Makefile are done, run:

  ```bash
  # compile all samples
  make
  ```

  ```bash
  # compile kernel_profiling_no_replay_sample.cpp
  make kernel_profiling_no_replay_sample
  ```

### How to run
Before running, ROCPROFILER_METRICS_PATH needs to be set to point to 'derived_counters.xml'
If the rocprofiler binaries are present in the rocm installation path /opt/rocm
then below command will work:
```bash
export ROCPROFILER_METRICS_PATH=/opt/rocm/libexec/rocprofiler/counters/derived_counters.xml
```

Otherwise, make it point to rocprofiler/build/counters/derived_counters.xml like below:
```bash
export ROCPROFILER_METRICS_PATH=<path_to_rocprofiler>/rocprofiler/buid/counters/derived_counters.xml
```

Finally, run a sample:
```bash
./kernel_profiling_no_replay_sample
```

## PC-Sampler
The ROCProfiler library includes an API to enable periodic sampling of the GPU
program counter during kernel execution. An example program is included that demonstrates the PC
sampling API, with additional code to illustrate a typical non-trivial use case:
correlation of sampled PC addresses with their disassembled machine code, as
well as source code and symbolic debugging information if available.
