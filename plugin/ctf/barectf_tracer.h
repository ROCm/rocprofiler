// A barectf tracer offers the AddEventRecord() method to add an event
// record which it will ultimately write to some CTF data stream file
// within some specified CTF trace directory.
//
// One important feature of such a tracer is that you don't need to add
// event records in order of time. A barectf tracer manages one or more
// barectf writers, each one managing a single barectf platform/context
// (CTF data stream file).
//
// All the CTF data stream files which a barectf tracer indirectly
// manages share a common specified prefix. You must not use the same
// prefix for two barectf tracers writing to the same CTF trace
// directory.
//
// `PlatformDescrT` is the specific barectf platform descriptor (see the
// documentation of the `BarectfPlatform` class template).

  // bytes to CTF data stream files having the prefix
  // `data_stream_file_name_prefix` within the CTF trace directory
  // `trace_dir`.
  //
  // The internal barectf writers manage event record queues having a
  // maximum size of `max_writer_queue_size`. Increasing
  // `max_writer_queue_size` increases the memory footprint of the
  // tracer, but may reduce the number of required CTF data stream files
