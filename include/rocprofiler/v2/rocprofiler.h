//
// ROC Profiler API
//
// The goal of the implementation is to provide a HW specific low-level
// performance analysis interface for profiling of GPU compute applications.
// The profiling includes HW performance counters (PMC) with complex
// performance metrics and traces.
//
// The library can be used by a tool library loaded by HSA runtime or by
// higher level HW independent performance analysis API like PAPI.
//
// The library is written on C and will be based on AQLprofile AMD specific
// HSA extension. The library implementation requires HSA API intercepting and
// a profiling queue supporting a submit callback interface.
//
//
/** \mainpage ROCProfiler API Specification
 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 *
 * ROCProfiler library, GPU Applications Profiling/Tracing APIs.
 * The API provides functionality for profiling GPU applications in kernel and
 * application and user mode and also with no replay mode at all and it
 * provides the records pool support with an easy sequence of calls, so the
 * user can be able to profile and trace in easy small steps, our samples code
 * can give good examples of how to use the API calls for both profiling and
 * tracing
 *
 * This document is going to discuss the following:
 * 1. @ref symbol_versions_group
 * 2. @ref versioning_group
 * 3. @ref status_codes_group
 * 4. @ref rocprofiler_general_group
 * 5. @ref timestamp_group
