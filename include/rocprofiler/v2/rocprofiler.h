//
// ROC Profiler API
//
// The goal of the implementation is to provide a HW specific low-level
// performance analysis interface for profiling of GPU compute applications.
// The profiling includes HW performance counters (PMC) with complex
// performance metrics and traces.
//
// The library can be used by a tool library loaded by HSA runtime or by
// higher level HW independent performance analysis API like PAPI.
//
// The library is written on C and will be based on AQLprofile AMD specific
// HSA extension. The library implementation requires HSA API intercepting and
// a profiling queue supporting a submit callback interface.
//
//
/** \mainpage ROCProfiler API Specification
 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 *
 * The ROCProfiler library provides GPU Applications Profiling/Tracing APIs.
 * The API offers functionality for profiling GPU applications in kernel,
 * application and user mode. It also supports no replay mode and provides
 * the records pool support through a simple sequence of calls. This enables
 * users to profile and trace in easy small steps. Our samples code provides
 * good examples on how to use the API calls for both profiling and
 * tracing.
 *
 * \section supported_amd_gpu_architectures Supported AMD GPU Architectures
 *
 * The following AMD GPU architectures are supported:
 *
 * - gfx900 (AMD Vega 10)
 * - gfx906 (AMD Vega 7nm also referred to as AMD Vega 20)
 * - gfx908 (AMD Instinct™ MI100 accelerator)
 * - gfx90a (Aldebaran)
 * - gfx940 (AMD Instinct™ MI300)
 * - gfx1010 (Navi10)
 * - gfx1011 (Navi12)
 * - gfx1012 (Navi14)
 * - gfx1030 (Sienna Cichlid)
 * - gfx1031 (Navy Flounder)
 * - gfx1032 (Dimgrey Cavefish)
 * - gfx1100 (Navi31)
 * For more information about the AMD ROCm ecosystem, please refer to:
 *
 * - https://docs.amd.com/
 *
*
 * \section known_limitations Known Limitations and Restrictions
 *
 * The AMD Profiler API library implementation currently has the following
 * restrictions.  Future releases aim to address these restrictions.
 *
 * 1. The following profiling modes are not yet implemented:
 *
 *    - ::ROCPROFILER_APPLICATION_REPLAY_MODE
 *    - ::ROCPROFILER_USER_REPLAY_MODE
 *
 * 2. While setting filters, properties can mix up and may produce
 *    undesirable results.
