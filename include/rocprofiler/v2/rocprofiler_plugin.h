/** \section rocprofiler_plugin_api ROCProfiler Plugin API
 *
 * The ROCProfiler Plugin API is used by the ROCProfiler Tool to output all
 * profiling information. Different implementations of the ROCProfiler Plugin
 * API can be developed that output the data in different formats. The
 * ROCProfiler Tool can be configured to load a specific library that supports
 * the user desired format.
 *
 * The API is not thread safe. It is the responsibility of the ROCProfiler Tool
 * to ensure the operations are synchronized and not called concurrently. There
 * is no requirement for the ROCProfiler Tool to report trace data in any
 * specific order. If the format supported by plugin requires specific
 * ordering, it is the responsibility of the plugin implementation to perform
 * any necessary sorting.
